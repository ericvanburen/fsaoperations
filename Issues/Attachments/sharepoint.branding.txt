v4.master — This is the default master page that is used for many of the site templates used
by SharePoint 2010

however, much of the main CSS for SharePoint still resides in one core CSS fi le named corev4.css

1024 × 768 to be the most common screen resolution, followed closely by 1280 × 800.

There are a few ways to apply custom CSS in SharePoint. One common mistake is to just log in
to the server and fi nd and edit the core SharePoint CSS fi le (corev4.css) in the SharePoint root.
This should be avoided because it is problematic in terms of supportability. If Microsoft releases an
update for SharePoint (which is inevitable), the corev4.css fi le in the SharePoint root is likely to be
overwritten. Also, changes to this fi le will apply branding to all web applications on the farm, which
is probably not the desired behavior.

Instead of editing the core CSS fi le, you should be overriding the default SharePoint styles.
This entails creating your custom CSS using the same CSS selectors provided out-of-the-box in
SharePoint and then ensuring that your CSS is loaded after the core CSS. SharePoint 2010 provides
two primary means for overriding SharePoint’s CSS with your own:

?? Alternate CSS — T his method enables you to easily apply custom CSS to a particular site and
all subsites below it. However, without writing custom code, alternate CSS is available only
from the SharePoint Web user interface in a SharePoint Server publishing site. If you have
SharePoint Server, alternate CSS is an easy way to ensure that custom CSS is loaded last.

?? CSS applied via custom master page — Through the use of a custom master page and the
CssRegistration tag, you can ensure that custom CSS is always loaded after the SharePoint
core CSS. This method is particularly well suited to creating custom branding because often a
custom master page is specifi cally tied to one or more custom CSS fi les. By applying the CSS
with CssRegistration, the two will always be applied together.

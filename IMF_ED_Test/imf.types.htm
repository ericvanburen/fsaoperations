<p class="style2"><strong>Refund Request – for excess garnishments or PCA refunds to borrowers</strong></p>
<span class="style3">Submit an IMF under this subject only if you (PCA) are requesting money to be refunded to you or if you are requesting a refund to an employer or borrower because the employer withheld too much of a borrower’s wages under a wage garnishment order.  You may request that money be refunded to you if you have refunded money to a borrower and the borrower negotiated the refund.  You will need to provide proof that the refund was negotiated along with the PCA address to which you want us to send the refund.  A refund may be due to an employer or borrower if the employer withheld wages in excess of the correct garnishment amount (e.g. the employer erroneously withheld 25 percent of disposable pay instead of 15 percent).  You must include the refund request from the employer as an attachment to this submission, which must include an explanation for the excess withholdings and the amount to be refunded.   

</span>   

<p class="style3">
Routine requests for refunds due to borrowers must be sent to Vangent through the following site: https://www.fsacollections.ed.gov/secure/imf/login.aspx.  Such requests would include accounts with a credit (negative) balance, payments received after the rehabilitation cutoff date, the certification of a consolidation loan, a final compromise payment, a favorable hardship determination has been rendered.  Other routine refunds would include payments received while a borrower is in bankruptcy, a duplicate or erroneous autopay or Speedpay payments not refunded to the borrower by the PCA, etc.</p>
